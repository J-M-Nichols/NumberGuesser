# Number Guesser
Number Guesser is a simple human vs. computer guessing game built with JavaScript. This project was created as part of the Codecademy Introduction to JavaScript course. The game generates a random target number between 0 and 9 at the start of each round. Both the human player and the computer make guesses, and the player whose guess is closest to the target number wins the round. The game keeps track of the scores and advances to the next round upon user interaction.
